# Virtual-Cricket-Game
# Programming With C and C++
Hi,I made this project during the eight weeeks online certified training on Programming with C and C++ by the Internshala.
I got to learn a lot during this Trainings Session and it was an amazing experience learning with INTERNSHALA.

<br>The Training Consisted of:

<li>Getting Started With Programming in C
<li>Diving into C Programming
<li>Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming using CPP
<li>Diving into CPP Programming and Building Cricket Game Application modules.
  
<br>I got to have hands on Projects on:
  
       "Virtual Cricket Game Application using CPP"
<br>and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these sessions and learned lot.
